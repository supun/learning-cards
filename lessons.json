Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the worldâ€™s most widely used general purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications. The <strong>sixth edition</strong> is the most extensive update to ECMAScript since the publication of the first edition in 1997.</p> <p>ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft).</p> ",

         "description":"<p>ECMAScript is an object-oriented programming language for performing computations and manipulating computational objects within a host environment. ECMAScript as defined here is not intended to be computationally self-sufficient; indeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results. Instead, it is expected that the computational environment of an ECMAScript program will provide not only the objects and other facilities described in this specification but also certain environment-specific objects, whose description and behaviour are beyond the scope of this specification except to indicate that they may provide certain properties that can be accessed and certain functions that can be called from an ECMAScript program..</p>",
